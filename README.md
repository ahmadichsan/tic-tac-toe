# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It is designed to be a fun and interactive way to play the game against another player.

## Features
- Two-player mode
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Reset and start new game functionality

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser or run the project on a local server.

## How to Play
1. Open the game using the instructions above.
2. Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on the 3x3 grid.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
